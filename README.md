**blackboard.rest**

The blackboard.rest library is an implementation of Blackboard Learn's REST
API's, written in Go.  Not all aspects of Blackboard's REST API has been
implemented, and it is likely not all parts will be (due to time constraints).

The interfaces provided by this library hopefully properly reflect what would
be expected by the users of the Blackboard REST API, or close enough thereof.
